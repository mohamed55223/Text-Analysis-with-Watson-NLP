# Car Complaint Analysis with Watson NLP

This repository contains code for analyzing car complaints using Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes the following major sections:

1. [Load the car complaints](#loadData)
2. [Analyze complaint descriptions with Watson NLP](#analyzeComplaints)
3. [Explore and analyze the results](#exploreResults)
4. [Identify nouns and noun phrases that are _specific_ to a given Model with Association Rule Mining](#correlate_n_nph)
5. [Summary](#summary)

## Table of Contents

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. [Load the car complaints](#loadData): This section loads the car complaints dataset and prepares it for analysis.
2. [Analyze complaint descriptions with Watson NLP](#analyzeComplaints): This section uses Watson NLP to analyze the complaint descriptions and extract insights from them.
3. [Explore and analyze the results](#exploreResults): This section explores and analyzes the results obtained from the complaint analysis.
4. [Identify nouns and noun phrases that are _specific_ to a given Model with Association Rule Mining](#correlate_n_nph): This section uses Association Rule Mining to identify nouns and noun phrases that are specific to a given car model.
5. [Summary](#summary): This section provides a summary of the findings and conclusions from the analysis.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: The code relies on the Watson NLP library and the `fpgrowth_py` library for Association Rule Mining. Install these dependencies using the package manager of your choice (e.g., `pip`).
2. Download the dataset: The code loads the car complaints dataset from a specific URL. Make sure you have a stable internet connection to download the dataset.
3. Run the code: Execute the code sections one by one to perform the car complaint analysis. Each section is documented with detailed explanations and instructions.

Please note that the code is written in Python and assumes basic familiarity with the language and its ecosystem. Make sure you have a Python environment set up with the required dependencies before running the code.
